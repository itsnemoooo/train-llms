Refactored the code into:
- model.py => codes related to modeling and transfomer architecture
- data.py => codes related to dataloader
- utils.py
- train.py => simplified training/evaluation loop on CPU for 10 examples

./tests
- pytests to check basic functionalities, not so functional at the moment, might have to adjust based on new modeling approaches
